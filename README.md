# MultiMol: Collaborative Expert LLMs Guided Multi-Objective Molecular Optimization

MultiMol is an advanced molecular optimization system that leverages collaborative large language models (LLMs) for multi-objective molecular optimization. This system consists of two synergistic agents: a data-driven worker agent and a literature-guided research agent. The worker agent is fine-tuned to generate optimized molecules considering multiple objectives, while the research agent uses literature insights to select the most promising candidates.

## Overview

Molecular optimization is a crucial process in drug development, yet it is often slow and resource-intensive. Traditional methods rely on trial and error, and AI-based methods have been limited in handling multi-objective optimization tasks. MultiMol overcomes these limitations by introducing a dual-agent system that guides the optimization process more effectively.

### Key Features:
- **Data-Driven Worker Agent**: Fine-tuned to generate optimized molecules based on scaffold and property specifications.
- **Literature-Guided Research Agent**: Searches relevant scientific literature to identify useful features and characteristics that guide the optimization process.
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Optimizes multiple molecular properties simultaneously, achieving better success rates compared to traditional methods.
- **Real-World Applications**: Successfully optimized molecules in real-world scenarios, such as improving selectivity in Xanthine amine congener (XAC) and enhancing the bioavailability of Saquinavir.
